# PrimeTime2
I just started to play with code based on TheVimeagen (ThePrimeagen) youtube video  - ***HTMX Part of the Ocaml Server***
The main http server with router is located in bin/main.ml file. In the /lib folder I created cool_lib library with icons and styles modules. Also in lib/layouts folder I located library with head and sidebar html page elements.
