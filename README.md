# PrimeTime2
I just started to play with code based on TheVimeagen (ThePrimeagen) youtube video  - ***HTMX Part of the Ocaml Server***

The main http server (Dune) with router is located in bin/main.ml file. In the /lib folder I created cool_lib library with icons (as SVG images) and styles (tailwind class lists) modules. Also in lib/layouts folder I located library with head element (with fonts and htmx library) and sidebar html page element.
